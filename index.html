  <ul>
    <li>I want to learn more about HTML since I'm terrible at it and this is my first time using it outside of Code.Zero</li>
    <li>I also want to know what it is like to be a software engineer besides "you write code"</li>
    <li>I want more experience working in groups</li>
    <li>This course doesn't have to do it, but I want to use this course to ease my anxiety over projects in general</li>
